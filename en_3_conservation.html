                Various solutions have been suggested for the sustainable use of living resources around the world. Korea has agreed to Convention on Biological Diversity and is executing diverse strategies to protect organisms and the environment nationwide. Considering today’s needs of biodiversity conservation, Hanwha Marine Biology Research Center is striving for the conservation of Marine life as well.
                <br><br>
                Ex-situ Conservation means the conservation of organisms in places other than their natural habitats takes place when it is difficult to preserve them in their environment, in order to protect them through intensive management and help them reproduce in an institute.<br> The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries can designate certain institutes to be Ex-situ Conservation Institute evaluation, when there is a need for certain organisms to be conserved in places other than their natural habitats.
                <br><br>
                The designated institute operates an optimal facility for the conservation of organisms and conducts research on breeding and the environment under the responsibility of professional keepers.

                        <p>Cetaceans, including the largest animal in the world, the blue whale, are marine mammals adapted to the marine environment the best with a thick layer of subcutaneous fat to protect their body temperature. There are about 80 species of Cetacean worldwide including large ones like the gray or blue whale, small whales like the porpoise, baird’s beaked whale and the narwhal with its characteristic long horn.
                            <br><br>
                            Whales are often spotted along the coastline of Korea. The blue and fin whales are spotted often as they have natural habitats around the world, and the minke and gray whales are seen as well. Besides these, porpoise and baird’s beaked whales inhabit nearby waters.
                            <br><br>
                            Whales are endangered from long term hunting for their oil, meat, and bones, which were all once considered useful resources,. Today, many countries have signed International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling to prevent their extinction.</p>

                            The elephant seal is a pinniped inhabiting the cold coasts of arctic areas. They are colossal mammals with an average length of 3.7 m and a weight of 1.4t. 
                            <br><br>They have been hunted for a long time for their oil producing blubber, meat, and proboscis. 
                            <br><br>In addition, their habitats have been devastated by climate change and the number of species is dropping dramatically.

                            Dokdo was a suitable environment for them as it had plenty of rocks and food to prey on, but they became extinct through overhunting in the early 20th century.
